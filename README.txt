Notes:
Honestly I'm pretty happy with how this project turned out! I've never coded in c++ before this class so I do apologize if I'm being improper
with memory or my syntax is not standard, I'm still figuring that out. However figuring out the different border cases was kinda fun, and
writing a program over a thousand lines long was not something I had ever done before. I looked extensively into header files for this
but I didn't really see how they would be helpful for my solution, so I may ask you about that eventually.
